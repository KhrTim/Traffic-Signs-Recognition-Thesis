# Traffic-Signs-Recognition-Thesis
Bachelor Thesis on topic "Recognition of road markings, signs and traffic lights using deep learning
models"

**NOTE: This is not a production-ready software. Application was created for learning and demonstrational purposes only.**

## How to run an appliction
1. Create a virtual environment
   Ex:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source ./venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install all requirements
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the `app.py` file
4. Choose mode, input source and file (or use camera if it was chosen on a previuos step)


## Pretrained weights can be downloaded from here: (or create your own)
**NOTE_1** It is important that trained models are named EXACTLY as follows:
- traffic_signs_detection.pt
- traffic_lights_detection.pt
- road_markings_detection.pt

**NOTE_2** All trained models must be placed in the same directory as run.py file (this project's root folder)
